### Changes:
- Moved i/o operations off the main thread.
- Improved performance with the bid command.

### Added:
- Folia Support

### Removed:
- Unicode checks for books, this might not be needed anymore due to recent Mojang/Paper changes, but I will add it back if an issue appears related to books.
